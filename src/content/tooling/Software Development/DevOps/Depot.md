# Value Proposition & Features

Depot is a **remote [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Docker|Docker]] build service** that runs your container builds on high‑performance cloud machines so they complete much faster than on local [[concepts/Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery|CI]] runners. [^swkr03] [^4glyxz] It integrates with existing Docker tooling and CI systems to provide “**exponentially faster builds for everyone**” by using persistent build cache, parallelization, and optimized hardware. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]

### Core product features:

- **Remote Docker builds:** Depot provides a drop‑in replacement for `docker build` that runs builds in its cloud, while keeping the same Dockerfile and [[Vocabulary/Command-Line Interfaces|CLI]] semantics. [^swkr03] [^4glyxz] Developers point their builds at Depot using a new `DOCKER_HOST` or CLI wrapper, offloading the heavy compute from local machines or CI runners. [^4glyxz]

- **Persistent build cache:** Depot maintains a remote, persistent build cache across builds and CI jobs, dramatically reducing build times for incremental changes. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag] The cache is stored in Depot’s infrastructure and reused automatically when layers have not changed. [^3b6mag]

- **OCI‑compatible registry support:** Depot pushes built images to any existing OCI‑compatible container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR), fitting into current deployment workflows without requiring a proprietary registry. [^4glyxz] [^3b6mag]

- **Team and project management:** Depot offers an organization‑level workspace with projects, API tokens, and per‑project configuration so teams can manage multiple services and environments. [^4glyxz] Usage and billing are grouped at the team level for easier cost management. [^4glyxz]

### Key features (priority order):

- **Remote, high‑performance Docker builds** that offload compute to Depot’s cloud. [^swkr03] [^4glyxz]  
- **Persistent, cross‑CI build cache** to accelerate incremental builds. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]  
- **Drop‑in Docker compatibility** via `DOCKER_HOST` or CLI wrapper, requiring minimal changes to existing workflows. [^4glyxz]  
- **Support for any OCI‑compatible registry** for pushing images. [^4glyxz] [^3b6mag]  
- **Team workspaces, projects, and API tokens** for collaborative use. [^4glyxz]  
- **Metrics and usage visibility** at project/organization level. [^4glyxz]  
- **CI integration** with common providers (e.g., GitHub Actions, others) via documented examples. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]

## Product Roadmap / Announcements

As of June 17, 2026,

- **2026‑05‑15 – New build metrics and insights:** Depot announced improved build metrics, including per‑step timing and cache hit visibility, to help teams optimize Dockerfiles and caches. [^3b6mag]  
- **2026‑03‑10 – Expanded CI integration guides:** Updated documentation and examples for integrating Depot with additional CI providers, emphasizing simple migration from local Docker builds. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]  
- **2026‑01‑22 – Enhanced organization management:** Release of features around organization‑level controls, including project scoping and more granular API token management. [^4glyxz]

## Recent Developments

- In the past 90 days, Depot has emphasized performance and observability improvements to its Docker build platform, adding richer build metrics and cache‑usage insights. [^3b6mag]  
- Documentation updates highlight smoother integration paths for CI platforms and clarify best practices for leveraging Depot’s remote cache. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]

# History and Origin Story

Depot was founded to solve the problem of slow Docker builds in CI by moving builds to fast remote machines and sharing cache across pipelines. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag] The founders observed that as codebases and microservices grew, traditional CI runners struggled with build performance, leading them to build a service that is compatible with existing Docker tooling but runs in a specialized, cache‑aware cloud environment. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag]

# Market Sizing

## Category, Market Size, and Category Growth

Depot operates in the **DevOps / CI/CD infrastructure** and **container build tooling** category, specifically focusing on remote Docker build and caching services used alongside CI providers and container registries. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag] Analyst estimates for the broader DevOps and CI/CD tools market place it within the fast‑growing cloud‑native development tools segment, but no source breaks out a specific sub‑market size for remote Docker build services tied directly to Depot. [^swkr03]

# Competitive Landscape

## Who it's for, who it's not for

Depot is for **software teams building containerized applications** that rely on Docker images and CI/CD pipelines, especially those with large [[Vocabulary/Monorepo|Monorepos]], many [[Vocabulary/Microservices|Microservices]], or slow container builds that want faster feedback loops. [^swkr03] [^3b6mag] It suits organizations already using existing container registries and CI providers but seeking a specialized, high‑performance build layer without rewriting Dockerfiles. [^4glyxz] [^3b6mag]

Depot is not ideal for teams that **do not use Docker or OCI containers**, or for very small projects where local builds are already fast enough and the overhead of an external build service is unnecessary. [^swkr03] It is also less suitable for environments that require all build infrastructure to run strictly on‑premises with no external cloud services. [^3b6mag]

## Viable Alternatives

- **Docker Build Cloud / Docker Hub‑integrated build services** – provides remote builds and caching integrated into the Docker ecosystem, competing directly on speed and convenience for Docker users.  
- **GitHub Actions with self‑hosted runners + Docker Buildx** – teams can provision powerful runners and use [[Tooling/Software Development/DevOps/Buildx]] caching to accelerate builds without a separate service.  
- **GitLab CI with built‑in Docker registry and runners** – integrated CI/CD and container registry solution that can be tuned for faster builds.  
- **CircleCI with remote Docker executors** – managed CI with specialized Docker execution environments that speed up container builds.
