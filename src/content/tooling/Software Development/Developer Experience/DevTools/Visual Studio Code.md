### Tool Use
2025, Mar 05. [How To Create Custom VSCode Snippets](https://youtu.be/TGh2NpCIDlc?si=tTxT6kZHc5YbbKMe) [[WebDev Simplified]] on [[YouTube]].

#### Create your own [[Keybindings]]

The [[Keybindings]] are stored in a JSON file at the following path:
`Users/[your-username]/Library/Application Support/[App Name]/User/keybindings.json`

For me, the path is:
`Users/mpstaton/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/User/keybindings.json`

The [[Keybindings]] JSON file takes this as the data:
```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[{
   "key": "ctrl+shift+c",
   "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
   "when": "editorIsOpen"
}
]
```

# VS Code Extensions
[[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] has a very robust [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]] library.

The extensions take a primary role, and VS Code has many subtle designs to encourage every user to access the extensions that will help them the most.  
![[Screenshot 2025-01-20 at 11.51.48 AM_VS-Code.png]]
Similar to an [[App Stores|App Store]], the [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]] feature within [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] manages extension updates, as well as helps users rid themselves of ones that are no longer supported.
![[Screenshot 2025-01-20 at 11.55.15 AM_VS-Code.png]]
[[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] also designs for [[Frictionless Commerce]], enabling [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]] providers to enact their own licensing and paywall policies -- using [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]]'s notification mechanisms:

[[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] also employs the [[Come one, come all]] approach, allowing anyone to try to build and publish an [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]]. Notice the "Build your own" and "Publish extensions" options in the upper right corner.

Because [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] has such a streamlined and open [[Extension Libraries|Extension Library]], most [[Vocabulary/Influencers]] developers do their demonstrations on [[YouTube]] using [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]].
