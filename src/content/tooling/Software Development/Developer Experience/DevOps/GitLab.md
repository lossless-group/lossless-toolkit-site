# GitLab is on the move

Your perception is accurate—GitHub still dominates the developer ecosystem with 81.1% usage among professional developers compared to GitLab's 35.6%, according to the 2025 [[Sources/UGC Communities/Stack Overflow|Stack Overflow]] survey. However, GitLab is indeed making meaningful traction, particularly in specific niches and use cases.[^bgj7tw] [^k8md0v]

## GitLab's Growth Drivers

GitLab has grown revenue 26-31% annually over the past two years, reaching $955 million in fiscal 2026. Several factors explain this growth:[^a1ex0c] [^o7zu3k][^g9vawg] [^j9g23j]

- **Integrated [[concepts/DevSecOps|DevSecOps]] platform**: GitLab bundles [[concepts/Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery|CI/CD]], container registry, security scanning ([[SAST]], [[Vocabulary/Dynamic Application Security Testing]]), and deployment tools in a single platform, reducing context-switching compared to GitHub's marketplace-dependent approach
- **Self-hosting advantages**: GitLab Community Edition allows free self-hosting anywhere, while GitHub Enterprise Server requires paid licenses plus infrastructure costs
- **CI/CD maturity**: GitLab CI/CD is more mature and integrated than GitHub Actions, making it popular with teams prioritizing automation pipelines
- **Java developer preference**: Over 35% of [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Java|Java]] developers opt for GitLab, indicating strong penetration in enterprise environments[^k8md0v]

## GitHub's Recent Challenges

Your observation about GitHub performance issues is well-documented. In April 2026, GitHub announced a plan to increase capacity by 10X after experiencing reliability problems related to unexpected bottlenecks from infrastructure migrations, user session cache redesign, and authentication flows that overloaded databases. The platform has also struggled with [[Vocabulary/Monorepo|Monorepo]] performance—GitHub and Git weren't originally designed for massive monolithic repositories.[^gyk9s3] [^b6g4f2][^3ckoh0]

## Alternative Platforms

Beyond GitHub and GitLab, several alternatives are gaining attention:[^tcpe4e] [^mqfpm1]

**Self-Hosted Options**:
- **[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/Gitea]]/[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/Forgejo|Forgejo]]**: Lightweight, single-binary Git hosting with minimal dependencies; Forgejo is a community-governed fork of Gitea emphasizing independence[^ky46w5] [^tcpe4e]
- **[[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Codeberg|Codeberg]]**: Nonprofit, community-owned platform running Forgejo; designed for FOSS projects with donation-based funding[^d3ll8d] [^c2mp9d]

**Cloud Platforms**:
- **[[SourceHut]]**: Minimalist, email-based workflows with a paid model that treats users as customers rather than products; emphasizes simplicity over feature bloat[^mqfpm1] [^tcpe4e]
- **[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/BitBucket|BitBucket]]**: Strong for teams already using [[organizations/Atlassian|Atlassian]]'s Jira ecosystem[^tcpe4e]
- **[[Tooling/Software Development/Cloud Infrastructure/Azure|Azure]] Repos**: Tight integration with Microsoft Azure DevOps services[^mqfpm1]

**Decentralized/Rethinking [[concepts/Version Control|SCM]]**:
- **[[Radicle]]**: Peer-to-peer, decentralized Git collaboration with no central server; repositories replicate across nodes using cryptographic identity[^26vcq7] [^tcpe4e][^mqfpm1]
- **[[Gitchain]]**: Earlier experiment applying blockchain concepts (Bitcoin/Namecoin) to Git hosting, though less active[^vtpl0r]

Radicle represents the most radical rethinking of collaborative SCM—it's fully peer-to-peer with no central authority, giving developers sovereignty through cryptographic signatures and offline-first workflows. This aligns more closely with Git's original distributed design philosophy than centralized platforms like GitHub.[^26vcq7] [^mqfpm1]

The trend you've noticed—projects listing both GitHub and GitLab, or GitLab-only—reflects growing diversification as developers seek alternatives to avoid vendor lock-in, especially given GitHub's Microsoft ownership and recent performance concerns.
