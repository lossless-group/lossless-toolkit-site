# Value Proposition & Features

Graphify is an **open‑source [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Knowledge Graphs|Knowledge Graph]] [[Knowledge Graph Engine]]** that turns code, documentation, databases, configuration, papers, meetings, images and other artifacts in a project folder into a **queryable knowledge graph** for AI coding assistants. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] It acts as a “**[[concepts/Explainers for AI/Memory Layers|Memory Layer]]**” for software projects so assistants can query a persistent graph instead of repeatedly scanning raw files with grep or ad‑hoc search. [^q0nlmu] [^93gnq8] This enables faster, more accurate understanding of complex codebases and technical systems for development, debugging, and architecture work. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^93gnq8]

## **Core product features**

- **Automated project graph building**  
Graphify crawls a project’s code, docs, SQL schemas, scripts, configuration, papers, images, video and audio, uses LLMs to extract entities and relationships, and emits a unified knowledge graph (e.g., `graph.json`). [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^po2oez] The [[Vocabulary/Command-Line Interfaces|CLI]] workflow is minimal: after installation, running `/graphify .` or `graphify build` maps the entire project into this graph for later querying without rescanning files. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^2wzifs]

- **Rich graph querying and navigation**  
Users can query the graph from the terminal with commands like `graphify query "show the auth flow"` or `graphify query "what connects DigestAuth to Response?"`, returning relevant subgraphs instead of large text dumps. [^oq4fia] [^2wzifs] Additional commands such as `graphify path "UserService" "DatabasePool"` find shortest paths between entities, and `graphify explain "RateLimiter"` gives plain‑language summaries of nodes. [^2wzifs]

- **Deep integration with AI coding assistants and MCP**  
Graphify is designed as an “AI coding assistant skill” and works in [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Claude Code|Claude Code]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Codex|Codex]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Agentic AI/OpenCode]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Cursor|Cursor]], Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot Chat, [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Aider|Aider]], Amp, [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Agentic AI/OpenClaw|OpenClaw]], Factory Droid, [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Trae AI|Trae AI]], Hermes, Kimi Code, [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Programming Frameworks/Kiro|Kiro]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/Pi Coding Agent|Pi.dev]], and Google [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/Antigravity CLI|Antigravity CLI]]. [^oq4fia] It can also be exposed as an [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Model Context Protocol|MCP]] (Model Context Protocol) server (`python -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json`) so assistants can repeatedly tool‑call into the same long‑lived graph. [^oq4fia]

- **On‑device or cloud, open‑source engine**  
Graphify is positioned as “the open‑source knowledge graph engine” that can run **on‑device or in the cloud** to index code, docs, papers, meetings and images into a traversable graph. [^q0nlmu] [^po2oez] This allows teams to keep sensitive code and knowledge artifacts local when needed, while still benefiting from LLM‑powered structure extraction and graph traversal. [^q0nlmu] [^po2oez]

**Key features (5–8 bullets, priority order)**  

- **Turn any folder of code, SQL schemas, scripts, docs, papers, images, videos into a queryable knowledge graph**. [^oq4fia] [^po2oez]  
- **Add a “[[concepts/Explainers for AI/Memory Layers|Memory Layer]]” over projects**, connecting code entities, documentation concepts, database tables, configuration, design notes and cross‑file relationships. [^q0nlmu] [^93gnq8]  
- **Simple CLI workflow**: `/graphify .` or `graphify build` to construct the graph, with output like `graphify-out/graph.json`. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^2wzifs]  
- **Graph queries from terminal** via `graphify query`, `graphify path`, and `graphify explain` for subgraphs, shortest paths, and node summaries. [^oq4fia] [^2wzifs]  
- **MCP server mode** for repeated, tool‑based access by AI assistants (`python -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json`). [^oq4fia]  
- **Broad assistant/editor support** including Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot Chat and multiple others. [^oq4fia]  
- **LLM‑powered entity and relationship extraction** from heterogeneous digital artifacts. [^po2oez]  
- **Open‑source distribution** installable via tools like `uv tool install graphifyy` followed by `graphify install`. [^2wzifs]

## Product Roadmap / Announcements

As of May 28, 2026,

- **2026‑05‑21** – An in‑depth article “Turning a Codebase into an AI‑Queryable Knowledge Graph” describes Graphify’s goals, workflow, and capabilities, positioning it as an evolving “memory layer” for AI coding assistants. [^q0nlmu]  
- **2025‑12‑11** – A product narrative “From 0 Insight to Infinite Connections: How Graphify Rewires Your Knowledge” outlines the broader vision of crawling digital artifacts, using LLMs to extract entities/relations, and supporting on‑device or cloud deployment; the piece implicitly serves as a roadmap towards broader personal/organizational knowledge graphs beyond just code. [^po2oez]  

No explicit public, time‑boxed feature roadmap (e.g., GitHub Projects or roadmap page) was found.

## Recent Developments (past 90 days)

- **2026‑05‑21** – Knightli publishes a detailed walkthrough of using `safishamsi/graphify` to turn codebases into knowledge graphs for Claude Code and other assistants, highlighting commands, output files, and integration patterns. [^q0nlmu]  
- **Approx. 2026‑04** – A YouTube video “Graphify Tested: A Knowledge Graph Index for Claude Code” demonstrates daily usage of `graphify build`, `graphify query`, `graphify path`, and `graphify explain`, as well as 30‑second installation via `uv tool install graphifyy` and `graphify install`. [^2wzifs]

# History and Origin Story

Graphify is an open‑source project maintained under the GitHub repository `safishamsi/graphify`, which describes it as an “AI coding assistant skill” that builds knowledge graphs from projects so assistants can query structure instead of files. [^oq4fia] A Corti engineering blog post credits Graphify as a way to bring knowledge graphs to AI‑assisted engineering by connecting code, documentation and infrastructure into a unified memory layer, indicating its origin in practical needs of software and AI tooling teams. [^93gnq8] Public sources do not provide a detailed founding date or full corporate formation story beyond the repository’s creation and early blog coverage.

# Competitive Landscape

## Who it's for, who it's not for

Graphify is for **software teams and developers** using AI coding assistants who want a persistent, structured understanding of their codebases—especially in large, multi‑language systems where code, docs, schemas, and infrastructure must be navigated as a graph for debugging, refactoring, onboarding, and impact analysis. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^93gnq8] It particularly suits engineers and organizations that are comfortable running open‑source tooling in their own environment (on‑device or self‑hosted cloud) and want to enhance assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot with long‑lived memory. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^2wzifs] [^po2oez]

It is not ideal for non‑technical users needing a simple note‑taking app, organizations seeking a fully managed SaaS with turnkey enterprise contracts, or teams that do not use AI coding assistants or do not wish to manage CLI‑based tooling and knowledge‑graph infrastructure. [^q0nlmu] [^oq4fia] [^po2oez] [^93gnq8] It is also less appropriate where security or policy constraints prohibit LLM‑based analysis of code and documents, even when run locally. [^po2oez] [^93gnq8]

## Viable Alternatives

- **Sourcegraph [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Agentic AI/Agentic Workspaces/Cody|Cody]]** – AI coding assistant with repository‑wide code intelligence and embeddings‑based search; alternative if teams want a hosted, integrated solution rather than a separate graph engine. [^93gnq8]  
- **[[CodeGraph]] – Other open‑source tools that index codebases into graphs for navigation, typically with different query models and less focus on MCP/assistant integration; specific OSS alternatives are referenced conceptually in knowledge‑graph‑for‑code discussions. [^po2oez] [^93gnq8]  
- **[[Tooling/Software Development/Databases/Neo4j|Neo4j]] – General‑purpose graph database where teams build their own ingestion pipelines to represent code and docs as nodes and edges, suitable for organizations that need full control and are willing to engineer their own assistant integration. [^po2oez]  
- **[[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Programming Frameworks/LangChain|LangChain]] / [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/LlamaIndex|LlamaIndex]]‑style retrieval frameworks]** – Frameworks that build vector indices and graph‑like structures over documents for LLM querying; they provide alternative approaches to structuring project knowledge without Graphify’s specific CLI and MCP integration. [^po2oez]
