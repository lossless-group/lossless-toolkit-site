# Value Proposition & Features

**Value proposition (2–3 sentences)**  
DoltHub is a **collaborative hosting and sharing platform for Dolt databases**, analogous to how [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/GitHub|GitHub]] hosts and manages Git repositories. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er] It lets teams **build, version, branch, diff, and distribute Dolt databases in the cloud**, enabling Git-style workflows on MySQL-compatible data. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3]

**Core product features (2–3 sentences each)**  

- **Hosted Dolt remotes & collaboration**  
  DoltHub provides **hosted remotes for Dolt databases**, so users can push, pull, and clone databases over the network much like Git remotes on GitHub. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3] It supports collaboration via permissions, forks, and pull-request-like workflows for database changes. [^m364er] [^1umwwu]

- **Web UI for data browsing and diffs**  
  DoltHub offers a browser-based interface to **view tables, run SQL queries, inspect history, and see row-level diffs across commits and branches**. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er] This UI surfaces Dolt’s version control metadata, making it easier to audit changes without using the CLI. [^m364er]

- **MySQL-compatibility via Dolt engine**  
  Underneath, DoltHub works with **Dolt, a MySQL-compatible database that supports Git-style commits, branches, and merges**. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3] Applications can connect to Dolt using the MySQL protocol, while teams manage schema and data history through Dolt/DoltHub workflows. [^3n1do3]

- **Data publishing and distribution**  
  Public DoltHub repositories let organizations **publish open datasets as version-controlled databases**, enabling users to clone, diff, and sync updates over time. [^5gcxbx] [^1umwwu] This supports reproducible analysis and transparent data updates for communities and data publishers. [^1umwwu]

**Key features (5–8 bullets, priority order)**  

- **Hosted Dolt repositories (remotes) for collaborative database version control**. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3]  
- **Git-like operations on data (clone, commit, branch, merge, diff) exposed through the DoltHub UI and API**. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er]  
- **SQL-based browsing, querying, and row-level diffing of database history in the browser**. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er]  
- **MySQL wire compatibility via the Dolt engine, enabling use with existing MySQL tools and clients**. [^3n1do3]  
- **Access controls and sharing for private and public databases, including organization-level collaboration**. [^m364er] [^1umwwu]  
- **Publishing and discovery of open, versioned datasets as DoltHub-hosted repositories**. [^5gcxbx] [^1umwwu]  

## Product Roadmap / Announcements

As of 2026-06-06,

- **2026-05-xx – Recent Dolt / DoltHub feature work**  
  No specific dated DoltHub roadmap or announcement posts in the last 6 months surfaced beyond ongoing Dolt engine and ecosystem work; official blog/news items specific to DoltHub hosting were not reliably identified. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er]
# History and Origin Story

DoltHub was created as the **hosting and collaboration service for Dolt**, a MySQL-compatible, Git-like version-controlled database developed by the same team behind the Dolt open source project. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3] Public materials focus on Dolt’s positioning as “the world's first and only version controlled database” and describe DoltHub as the place “where people collaboratively build, manage, and distribute Dolt databases,” but detailed founding dates, individual founders’ names, and specific historical inflection points for DoltHub are not provided in the surfaced sources. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3]

## Notable Team Members

Public search results describing DoltHub as a product and website for Dolt databases do not provide authoritative, up-to-date information on founders or current leadership by name; no specific individuals could be cited as notable team members without resorting to low-confidence inference. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3]

# Market Sizing

## Category, Market Size, and Category Growth

DoltHub operates in the **cloud database hosting and collaboration** category, specifically as a **hosted service for a MySQL-compatible, version-controlled database (Dolt)**. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3] This places it at the intersection of **cloud databases (DBaaS), data versioning, and developer collaboration platforms**, analogous to how GitHub serves source code but focused on relational data. [^5gcxbx] [^m364er] No analyst-grade market sizing was found specifically for version-controlled relational databases or for DoltHub, but it fits within the broader, rapidly growing cloud database and DBaaS markets discussed by industry analysts, which project strong double-digit growth for managed database services; however, no source directly attributes a quantified market size to DoltHub’s exact niche. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3]

# Competitive Landscape

## Who it’s for, who it’s not for

DoltHub is for **teams that need Git-style version control on relational data**, such as data engineers, analysts, and developers who want to track and review schema and data changes with the same rigor as source code, and who can work within a **MySQL-compatible** environment. [^5gcxbx] [^3n1do3] It is especially suited to organizations that publish or collaborate on shared datasets and want cloneable, diffable, and auditable database histories in a cloud-hosted service. [^5gcxbx] [^1umwwu]

DoltHub is not a fit for organizations that **require fully managed, horizontally scalable transactional databases without version-control semantics**, or that are tightly coupled to non-MySQL ecosystems (e.g., PostgreSQL-only shops) and do not wish to adopt Dolt. [^3n1do3] It is also less appropriate for users who only need basic SQL hosting without the overhead or conceptual shift of Git-like branching and merging on data. [^3n1do3]

## Viable Alternatives

- **[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/GitHub|GitHub]] (for data in files)** – Storing data as CSV/Parquet and versioning via GitHub can provide change history and collaboration, but lacks native SQL queries and relational constraints. [^m364er]  
- **[[Tooling/Data Utilities/LakeFS|LakeFS]]\** – Provides Git-like version control for object-store data lakes, targeting analytics data rather than MySQL-compatible relational databases. [^3n1do3]  
- **DVC (Data Version Control)** – A Git-based data versioning tool for machine learning datasets, focused on file-based data rather than live SQL databases. [^3n1do3]  
- **Standard MySQL DBaaS (e.g., RDS MySQL)** – Managed MySQL services give hosted relational databases but do not provide Dolt-style branching, merging, or row-level diffs in the engine. [^3n1do3]  

## Competitor Table


| Competitor | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [GitHub]   | General-purpose Git hosting for source code and data files; offers version control and collaboration but no native SQL database engine. |
| [LakeFS]   | Git-like data versioning for object-store data lakes, enabling branching and commits on large analytic datasets rather than MySQL-compatible tables. |
| [DVC]      | Git-based data version control tool for ML and analytics, versioning datasets as files instead of providing a relational database. |
| [Amazon RDS for MySQL] | Managed MySQL database service offering backups, scaling, and operations, but without Dolt-style commit/branch/merge semantics on data. |
